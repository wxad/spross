# Drawer

The navigation drawers (or "sidebars") provide ergonomic access to destinations in a site or app functionality such as switching accounts.

Inspirations are [here](https://wxad.design/abc/drawer).

## Basic Usage

`placement`, `padding` Props, `border-radius` will added automatically when `padding` is set:

<Basic />

## Elevated

Elevated drawer will scale down `data-spross-drawer-wrapper` when open, you need to set this attribute manually to the wrapper element.

When `elevation` is set, `padding` prop will be ignored:

<Elevated />

## Steps

`step` prop is used to control the steps of the drawer transition. You need to use it with `steps` & `stepTransitionType` prop.

There are two types of `stepTransitionType` you can choose, `slide` & `fade`:

<Steps />
