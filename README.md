# [Spross](https://wxad.design/spross) - Interface overlays that 'sprout' from elements

# About Spross

## Background

I've been struggling with the design language in our business.

When I want to refine it properly, I find myself torn between modifying individual components one by one or starting a full redesign of the entire design language.

For now, I’ve taken a middle-ground approach — I tend to use a verb to encapsulate certain components with similar behaviors, and that’s where 'Spross' comes from (it means 'sprout' in German).

I’m not deliberately using another foreign language, it’s just that registering a unique npm package is really challenging.

Similarly, I created another library called [Sprung](https://wxad.design/sprung).

So spross, as a design system concept, describes lightweight, contextually triggered components that dynamically grow from other elements.

## Purpose

Of course, I don’t want to create components that feel outdated. I want each repetition to at least be infused with new creativity. Therefore, they should either have interesting features or be a result of my rethinking of best practices.
